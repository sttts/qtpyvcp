===================
Development Install
===================

This installation method should be used if you are interested in
contributing to `QtPyVCP`, or want to have access to the source
code so you can study it and see how everything works.

This type of installation is editable, meaning you can make changes to
the source files and the changes will take effect when `QtPyVCP` is next
run, without the need to manually update or reinstall anything.


.. Note::

    If you are **not** interested in development then it is simpler to
    install from PyPi per the :doc:`Standard Install <pypi_install>` guide.


.. Warning::

    Before proceeding make sure you have satisfied the prerequisites listed on
    the :doc:`Prerequisites <prerequisites>` page!


Getting the QtPyVCP Source Code
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you intend to contribute to QtPyVCP you should clone the
`QtPyVCP repository <https://github.com/kcjengr/qtpyvcp>`_ with git::

  git clone https://github.com/kcjengr/qtpyvcp qtpyvcp

Otherwise you can simply download the source code archive:
:download:`qtpyvcp-master.tar.gz <https://github.com/kcjengr/qtpyvcp/tarball/master>`


Install Dev Dependencies
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Development dependencies (in addition to those listed on the :doc:`Prerequisites <prerequisites>`) page::

  sudo apt install qttools5.dev qttools5-dev-tools wheel

For building documentation::

  pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme mock

(From the docs dir run ``make html`` to build the HTML documentation.)


**Note:** *We try to keep this up to date, but if you find additional
dependencies are needed please notify one of the developers so it
can be added.*


Install with pip
+++++++++++++++++++++

.. warning::

    If you previously installed QtPyVCP using the standard install method
    you should first uninstall with ``pip uninstall qtpyvcp`` before proceeding
    to avoid the possibility of multiple installations conflicting.

From the qtpyvcp source directory install QtPyVCP by running::

  pip install --editable .

This will create a setup.py development install and will add command line scripts to
``~/.local/bin/`` for launching QtPyVCP, the example VCPs and the command line tools.

.. hint::
    If the pip install fails, try uninstalling before trying to install again.
    ``pip uninstall qtpyvcp``

.. note::
    On Debian 9 (Stretch) ``~/.local/bin/`` is not on the PATH due to a regression in bash.
    This prevents being able to launch qtpyvcp from the command line or being able to use it
    as the ``[DISPLAY]DISPLAY`` directive in the LinuxCNC INI file. For a single shell session
    you can get around this by running ``export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin/`` before launching
    linuxcnc or any qtpyvcp commands.

    A more permanent solution is to copy the `.xsessionrc` file from the
    `qtpyvcp/scripts` directory into your home direcotry, then log out and log
    back in. This will add ``~/.local/bin/`` to your PATH each time xwindows
    starts. In the file manager select View > Show Hidden Files in order to see
    files that start with a dot like `.xsessionrc`.


Testing the Install
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Confirm that QtPyVCP installed correctly and is available by running::

  qtpyvcp -h

This will print a list of command line options if the installation was
successful.

QtDesigner Plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to edit a VCP or create one from a template you need to have the
QtDesigner plugins installed. To load, you must have the correct version of
`libpyqt5.so` in `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5/plugins/designer/`. Precompiled
libraries suitable for 64Bit Debian Stretch (or other system with Qt v5.7.1 and
Py v2.7) are included in the `QtDesigner` directory. The easiest way to install
the libs to the correct location is to use the `install.sh` script located in
the `qtpyvcp/pyqt5designer/Qt5.7.1-64bit` directory with this command.
::

    sudo ./install.sh

If you are using a different architecture or Qt version you may need to compile PyQt5 from
source to get the proper `libpyqt5.so` file. The steps should be similar those listed
`here <https://gist.github.com/KurtJacobson/34a2e45ea2227ba58702fc1cb0372c40>`_.

Trouble shooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you get an error about `Make sure that you have the correct version of the
libpyqt5.so` you probably installed the stock version of Qt Designer over the
QtPyVCP version. To fix that just install libpyqt5 with the install script.
